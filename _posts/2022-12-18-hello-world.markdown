**Hello, World!** is the most famouse word that most of software developer in the world use to print on their first console or graphic application. I am one of them.

So why they use that word? is there meaning behind it that we did not know of?

Today, I am going to write about why "Hello, World!" is the world most famouse word for the software developers.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), A "Hello, World!" program is generally a computer program that ignores any input and outputs or displays a message similar to "Hello, World!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language, and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.

The first step is always the most difficult one. To write a correct syntax to print "Hello, World!" is easy but it is not actually the first step of journey. The first step you take is that decision and commitment that you will make time to learn about programming. The "Hello, World!" is simply just the first result that you've start this wonderful journey.

Take a deep breath and enjoy the world of coding.

Down below are the syntax of how to print "Hello, World".
